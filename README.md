Creators: Harshit Patel(@hpatel24) and Sagar Bajaj(@sbajaj)

Civilization is a Strategic Game where individiual players would strategically explore a hidden map and expand their empire. It can be played by two players on a turn by turn basis. They can either move, attack or grab a resource.

Map is divided into different terrains, that are Mountains, Water and Flatland. If a player is on mountain they can see more area of land then they could if they were on flatland or water. If a player is in water then no other player can attack on him.

When a player is on mountain they can attack other player from a farther distance but the probability of other player dying is only 20%.

A player can also choose to do a diplomacy deals. Where a player can propose something like "No attacks for next 5 turns, etc." The other player can accept or reject it.
